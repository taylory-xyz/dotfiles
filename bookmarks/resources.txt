ad hominem (in politics, "mud-slinging")		attacking an opponent's motive or character instead of their stance on the issue
begging the question		presenting a debatable premise as if it were fact
either/or fallacy		asserting that a situation can have only two possible outcomes
generalization		reaching a conclusion based on insufficient evidence
misleading statistics		use of statistical evidence with the intent to mislead
non sequitur		a statement that does not follow logically from what preceded it
oversimplification		providing a naively simple solution to a complex problem
post hoc ergo propter hoc / post hoc / "association is causation" fallacy		assuming an earlier event caused a later event, even when there may be no connection at all
red herring		a distracter; draws attention from the real issue
slippery slope		an argument that says adopting one policy or taking one action will lead to a series of other policies or actions also being taken, without showing a causal connection between the advocated policy and the consequent policies
straw man		refuting a caricatured or extreme version of somebody's argument, rather than the actual argument they've made

Rhetorical Analysis Essays
Conclusions
look outward: make real-world connections
consider author's theme/purpose
use a long sentence that builds structurally and also in ideas
use antithesis/parallelism to create a sense of closure
use a quote/simile/metaphor to capture the essence of your argument
use a quote/address an unanswered question; use "maybe" or "perhaps" to offer a nuanced answer
Body Paragraphs
main idea/ focus of body paragraphs; should be analytical, making a claim about some aspect of the book
more than 8 sentences in a body paragraph is usually too long
relationship between ideas in the paragraphs: how do they build (chronologically? 1st/2nd/3rd, are ideas equal? diction/syntax/tone, what is the relationship (what creates what)?)
transition words/phrases (first/second/third - numerical, also/additionally/furthermore - another thing, however/nonetheless/yet - contrast, indeed/ultimately/for - emphasis); remember, you can also link the idea of the previous paragraph to the next one
quotes - 2-4 word quotes are most powerful; sentences with quotes also contain analysis
new/interesting connections to your thesis at the end of each paragraph; assume the reader is smart; what new ideas can you develop as your essay builds in complexity (what facets of your thesis can you explore more in-depth? ask yourself HOW and WHY of claims you make)?
